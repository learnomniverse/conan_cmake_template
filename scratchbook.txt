# build AND install in "package" subdirs immediately whatever conanfile.py is contained int he 'deps/kit-sdk' dir
conan create deps/kit-sdk
(
another less useful command:
    # do not build but keep in cache downloaded, will build at the first use
    conan export .
)

# used not for building packages but for GATHERING and INSTALLING (if needed) DEPS of APPS - need another conanfile.py
# use THIS for the main app conanfile.py
conan install . --output-folder _compiler


# finally use cmake as set up by conan
cd build && cmake --preset conan-release ..
